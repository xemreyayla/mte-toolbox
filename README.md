This section explains how to run the application.

### Getting Started 
This section describes how to run the application.

#### Executing program
The first page that will be displayed when the program opens is the connection page. When the program starts, if a serial adapter (similar to USB) is connected to the computer, it will be automatically detected and listed under the "Active Ports" section.
To establish a connection, select the desired port from the list and click the Connect button. 
The Refresh button is used to re-scan and list currently active and available ports.
To terminate the connection, click the Disconnect button. It is recommended to disconnect before changing devices or exiting the application.

If no port is connected before the program starts, the USB port that is connected after the program starts will not appear until the refresh button is pressed.

Once the desired port is selected, the 'Connect' button must be pressed. Afterward, a notification will appear confirming that the port connection has been successfully established.

After the connection is established, you can proceed to the device info page. On this page, information about the device can be viewed.
